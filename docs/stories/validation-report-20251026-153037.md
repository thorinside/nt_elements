## Failed Items
None.

## Partial Items
- MCP doc search performed (or web fallback) and references captured — Need to execute an MCP doc or web search in future runs to satisfy documentation lookup requirements.

## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: None.
2. Should Improve: Execute an MCP doc search (or approved web fallback) during review to capture external references.
3. Consider: Automate capturing manual nt_emu validation notes for AC #4 coverage.
